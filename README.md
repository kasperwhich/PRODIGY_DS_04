## Introduction
Welcome to my submission for Task 4 of the Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech.

## Problem Statement:
To analyze and visualize sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands.

## Dataset:
Utilized a rich dataset from Kaggle, specifically the Twitter Entity Sentiment Analysis dataset.

## Tools and Libraries used:

- Entity-Specific Analysis:
  Created detailed visualizations to show sentiment distribution across different entities, highlighting which entities are viewed more favorably or unfavorably by the public.
- Heatmap Visualization:
  Used heatmaps to effectively display sentiment patterns, providing a clear and intuitive understanding of the data.
